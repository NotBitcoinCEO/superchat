# Overview

In this app I was looking to create a simple chat app. This was a difficult project for me as I have little experience with online databases. Let just say I learned a lot with this project. 

The easiest way to use this app is to open it up, sign-in, type something, and hit enter. It's that easy!

The purpose for this app is to create a way for my friends and I to chat in a customizable environment.

# Development Environment

To create this I used Google's online Firebase and many different online resources to help me learn. 
I used React and very helpful was Firebase's built in scripts to establish particular parts of this app.

# Future Work

* I'm in great need of being more organized. My app was all over the place!
* I'm learning the process of regularizing particular parts of my code. I would like to be more consistent. 
* In this chat app there were certain portions I need to draw from online help. I need more practice doing it from scratch.
